# 5. LINUX KERNEL DEVELOPMENT

## DESCRIPTION
Developers will understand Linux specific constructs and how to perform Linux kernel programming

## TASK LIST
* [ ] 1. Implement a basic kernel module (2b)
* [ ] 2. Load and unload modules from user and kernel space (2b)
* [ ] 3. Understand, populate, and use Kernel Structures (process, linked lists, memory management) (2c)
* [ ] 4. Implement Signal Handling within the kernel (2b)
* [ ] 5. Understand and use different types of kernel Memory and when it's appropriate to use each type (2b)
* [ ] 6. Understand interrupt contexts, their implications, and be able to implement code that runs in various contexts (2b)
* [ ] 7. Understand page tables, when memory is paged to disk, and how memory is transitioned from main memory to swap (COW, write-back, etc) and will use these as part of their development in Linux (2b)
* [ ] 8. Demonstrate understanding of the different kernel Synchronization primitives and when to use them (2c)
* [ ] 9. Demonstrate understanding of the role of Symbol Resolution during the different stages of kernel development (compile time, link time, runtime) (2c)
* [ ] 10. Understand the difference between System Calls and Library Functions (B)
* [ ] 11. Understand how Filter Drivers work and be able to implement one (2c)
* [ ] 12. Demonstrate the ability to manipulate Key Kernel Structures (2c)
* [ ] 13. Describe the use and benefits of Symmetric Multi Processing and the importance of process IDs and thread group IDs (C)
* [ ] 14. Demonstrate the ability to Process IDs/Thread Group IDs
* [ ] 15. Have a full understanding of and be able to use strace to identify all system calls invoked by an application (3c)
* [ ] 16. Understand how processes are scheduled and various scheduling strategies and be able to use these techniques in development (B)
* [ ] 17. Understand how file systems are implemented as kernel modules (B)
* [ ] 18. Receive and respond to an ioctl issed from user space (3c)
* [ ] 19. Implement Block and Character Device modules (2c)
* [ ] 20. Use Debugger Techniques to successfully implement kernel modules (3c)
* [ ] 21. Enable core dumps and analyze them with gdb (4c)
* [ ] 22. Create user mode applications that interact with kernel code (3c)
* [ ] 23. Understand how the kernel handles Plug and Play and Hardware Discovery (B)
* [ ] 24. Basic understanding of Direct Memory Access (DMA) (A)
* [ ] 25. Demonstrate the ability to write code that handles Interrupts (software/hardware) (2b)
* [ ] 26. Demonstrate their fundamental understanding of Deferring Work using queues and kthreads (2c)
* [ ] 27. Use dmesg to assist in debugging of kernel modules (2b)
